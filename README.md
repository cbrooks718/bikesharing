The purpose of this project was to create visualizations using Tableau from CitiBike data in NYC to help investors begin a bikeshare program in Des Moins, Iowa. Some key questions that were used in this analysis were:
- Where are the most popular starting/ending locations?
- What time of day are bikes used the most/least?
- Who uses the bikes the most and how long are the bikes being used for by whom?
